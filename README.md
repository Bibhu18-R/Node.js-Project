# Node.js-Project
Project Description: Dockerized Node.js Service Deployment using GitHub Actions
Introduction

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of developing, containerizing, and deploying a simple Node.js service using modern DevOps practices. It integrates Docker for containerization, GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and a remote Linux server for hosting. The project highlights best practices in automated deployment, container management, and secrets handling.

Top-Level Files

.dockerignore
Specifies files and directories to exclude when building the Docker image (e.g., node_modules, logs). Helps keep images small and clean.

.env
Stores environment variables such as PORT, API keys, or secrets. Used to configure the Node.js app without hardcoding values in code.

Dockerfile
Instructions to build the Docker image of the Node.js service. It defines the base image (node:18-alpine), installs dependencies, copies source files, exposes port 3000, and sets the startup command.

package.json
Project metadata and dependencies. Defines app name, version, required libraries (express, etc.), and scripts (e.g., npm start).

package-lock.json
Auto-generated file that locks exact dependency versions to ensure consistent builds across environments.

readme.md
Documentation file explaining how to set up, run, and use the project. Usually includes installation, usage, and deployment steps.

server.js
The main Node.js application file. It starts an Express.js server and listens on a defined port. Responds to requests (e.g., GET / → “Hello World” message).

Directories

node_modules/
Contains all the installed dependencies for the Node.js service (like express, body-parser, etc.). This folder is generated automatically when running npm install.

Inside, you can see packages like:

accepts/ → Helps handle HTTP Accept headers.

basic-auth/ → Provides basic authentication middleware.

body-parser/ → Parses incoming request bodies in middleware.

bytes/ → Utility for handling data sizes.

(and many more libraries required by Express).

How Everything Works Together

server.js defines the Node.js Express service.

package.json and package-lock.json manage dependencies.

.env provides environment-specific configuration.

Dockerfile containerizes the app for deployment.

.dockerignore ensures unnecessary files aren’t copied into the container.

node_modules/ contains dependencies (not usually committed to GitHub since Docker and npm can rebuild them).

readme.md explains usage for developers.
